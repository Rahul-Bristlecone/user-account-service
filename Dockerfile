# Stage 1: Builder stage
# Purpose: Build and install all Python dependencies in an isolated environment
# -------------------------------
FROM python:3.12-slim AS builder
WORKDIR /app

# Upgrade pip, setuptools, and wheel to ensure compatibility with latest packages
# This helps avoid issues with outdated tooling when installing dependencies
RUN pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

# Copy dependency list into container and install them
# --no-cache-dir prevents caching wheels, reducing image size
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy application source code into builder stage
# This ensures any local modules are available during dependency resolution
COPY . ./user_service


# -------------------------------
# Stage 2: Final stage - Runtime environment
# Purpose: Create a minimal, secure runtime image with only necessary artifacts
# -------------------------------
FROM python:3.12-slim

# Create a dedicated non-root user for running the application
# Running as non-root improves container security by limiting privileges
RUN groupadd -r usergroup && useradd -r -g usergroup user

# Copy installed dependencies and application code from builder stage
# This avoids reinstalling dependencies in the final image, saving time and space
COPY --from=builder /usr/local /usr/local
COPY --from=builder /app /app

# Adjust ownership of application files so the non-root user can access them
RUN chown -R user:usergroup /app

# Set environment variables:
# - PATH ensures Python binaries are accessible
# - PYTHONPATH allows imports from /app without modifying sys.path in code
ENV PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
ENV PYTHONPATH=/app

# Switch to non-root user for all subsequent operations

# Expose application port (5000) for external access

# Define a health check to monitor container availability
# - Runs every 30s, times out after 10s
# - Retries 3 times before marking container unhealthy
# - Uses Python socket to verify the app is listening on port 5000

# Using explicit Python invocation ensures consistent entrypoint behavior
